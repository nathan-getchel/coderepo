All requirements have been met to the best of my knowledge. No extra credit features were attempted. I was glad to discover that a successful project 1 made this project relatively easy. Most functions could be copied over entirely, and after modifications to input and output worked perfectly. The change to function calls because of using classes was also straightforward. The only new functions were the constructors and destructor, and they were very simple.
